<h4>Firstly, I worked on the navigation bar for the website. I wanted it to look appropriate for the assignment,
 so I looked up some sample website desings to find a reference to work on.Then, I attempted to figuire out how
to use the css flex layout so I can start making my site. </h4>

<h4>I started making my portfolio page by looking at sample website designs. Eventually, I found a design I liked my 
page to be based on. I started using new tags, some more complex to understand then others. I added the placeholder pictures including the description.
I find this design to be quite simple and it looks good aswell.</h4>

<div> <b> 25th May, 2021</b> </div>

<h4>Finally I prepared a base design for all the pages I need to create. I also made sure the colors of different sections of the website were nice to look at.
	I've started learning how to create a more responsive navigation bar as well. </h4>

<div> <b> 27th May,2021</b> </div>
<h4> Today, I've updated the looks for the Navigation bar as I found a better version of the former that blends in nicer with the design of the website.
	The content of the index page needed to be worked out more as well so I added a few lines more.</h4>

<h4> I completed my curriculum vitae page. I attemped to round out the profile picture but it just didn't seem that good. So I decided on using the default image shape for my page. I changed up the color pallete of the webpage a little too as I thought I could make it better. It turned out to look great.</h4>

<div> <b> 4th July,2021</b> </div>
<h4> As the submission deadline closes today, I worked quickly to finish my contact as well as my sitereport page and managed to put up a decent looking site. 
	I plan to keep improving the design of the site as I learn more and more about web designing. And hopefully one day I shall create a professional looking website.
